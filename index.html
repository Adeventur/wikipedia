                             <p>The 1899 Kentucky gubernatorial election was held on November 7, 1899. The Republican incumbent, William Bradley, was term-limited. The Democrats chose William Goebel. Republicans nominated William Taylor. Taylor won by a vote of 193,714 to 191,331. The vote was challenged on grounds of voter fraud, but the Board of Elections, though stocked with pro-Goebel members, certified the result. Democratic legislators began investigations, but before their committee could report, Goebel was shot by an unknown assassin (event pictured) on January 30, 1900. Democrats voided enough votes to swing the election to Goebel, Taylor was deposed, and Goebel was sworn into office on January 31. He died on February 3. The lieutenant governor of Kentucky, J. C. W. Beckham, became governor, and battled Taylor in court. Beckham won on appeal, and Taylor fled to Indiana, fearing arrest as an accomplice. The only persons convicted in connection with the killing were later pardoned; the assassin's identity remains a mystery. (Full article...)</p>
